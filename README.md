An Rshiny app for collating forecasting contest entries from GitHub

> [!WARNING] This is very much a Work In Progress so please be patient and don't expect too much just yet!

This RShiny app is designed to be used with the [Turing forecasting contest template](https://github.com/TuringPPL/forecasting-contest-template), which has a standardised structure for submissions.
